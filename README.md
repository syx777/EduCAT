<!-- **<font size=5>Computerized Adaptive Testing Package, including the following models and strategies.</font>** -->
This Python library offers a streamlined solution for rapidly developing a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) system. It encompasses a comprehensive suite of tools that integrate both traditional statistical methods and recent machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## ‚ùó What is CAT About?

**Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)** stands as one of the earliest and most successful integrations of educational practices and computing technology.  
CAT is a dynamic and interactive process between a student and a testing system. If traditional paper-and-pencil tests are "one-for-all," then CAT is "one-for-each". Each student gets a personalized test that adapts to their proficiency level and knowledge, ensuring each question accurately assesses and challenges them. CAT tailors the selection of questions to each student‚Äôs level of proficiency, thereby maximizing the accuracy of the assessment while minimizing the test length. 


The CAT system is split into two main components that take turns: At each test step, the Cognitive Diagnosis Model (CDM), as the user model, first uses the student‚Äôs previous  responses to estimate their current proficiency, based on cognitive science or psychometrics. Then, the Selection Algorithm picks the next question from the bank according to certain criteria.This two-step process repeats until a predefined stopping rule is met, and the final estimated proficiency (i.e., diagnostic report) of individual students will be fed back to themselves as the outcome of this assessment or for facilitating future learning.

## üìï Machine Learning-Based Methods
### üîçCognitive Diagnosis Models (CDM)
Cognitive Diagnosis Model (CDM), as the user model, first uses the student's previous responses to estimate their current proficiency, based on cognitive science or psychometrics.

<!-- Item Response Theory (IRT) is a statistical model used to assess individual abilities and traits. students‚Äô proficiencies and question difficulties are handled as overall attributes reflected in students‚Äô historical response data. These attributes can be single or multidimensional and are estimated through latent parameter estimation techniques. 


#### Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NCD)
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NCD) is a cutting-edge framework designed to tackle the challenges inherent in cognitive diagnosis, in response to the complex and non-linear interactions between students and questions. In NCD models, we project students and questions to factor vectors and incorporates neural networks to learn the complex exercising interactions.  -->

### ‚úèÔ∏èSelection Algorithm
 Then, the \textbf{Selection Algorithm} picks the next question from the \textbf{Question Bank} according to certain criteria \cite{lord2012applications, chang1996global, bi2020quality}. Most traditional statistical criteria are informativeness metrics, e.g., selecting the question whose difficulty matches the student's current proficiency estimate, meaning the student has roughly a 50\% chance of getting it right \cite{lord2012applications}. The above process repeats until a predefined stopping rule is met, and the final estimated proficiency (i.e., diagnostic report) of individual students will be fed back to themselves as the outcome of this assessment or for facilitating future learning. 


<!-- The purpose of CAT is to assess students' abilities with minimal items and high accuracy. The item selection algorithm can be divided into two types: information-based selection and data-driven selection. The most famous traditional information-based selection algorithm is Fisher Information (FSI). In addition, there are other item selection algorithms such as Kullback-Leibler Information. In recent years, the MAAT algorithm based on active learning and the BECAT algorithm based on core subset have been proposed, which can better adapt to the NCD model. BOBCAT, NCAT, and other algorithms treat item selection as a reinforcement learning problem and train the item selection algorithm with a large amount of student data to solve the problem. -->
